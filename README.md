*A collection of PC programs & software tools for model railway hobbyists.*

## DCC-EX

A simple Plug-n-Play, low-cost electronics project that will **drive your DCC layout** (locos, accessories, and animations!), including ***full automation of everything*** via basic scripting! *Wow!*

Visit www.dcc-ex.com to learn about setting up your own fully featured DCC System: **DCC++EX**, now with **EX-RAIL!**
Also, contact the actual Developer team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AUxvMZH9VZ), to say *Hello!* or find *first-class support.* Awesome!

Just get yourself an Arduino microcontroller board, add on a little motor shield to connect to the tracks, maybe add a WiFi shield for more controller options (like a free smartphone app!), load the free DCC++EX program into it, and away you go! **Easy as!**

This software is mature and stable, and is well able to run anything from mini switching puzzle layouts, right up to gigantic museum layouts! 
It's open source code, so you can view and contribute to the magic on GitHub! Even if it's "just" helping with documentation, which is always welcomed...

## EX-RIDE

Connect this PC program to your **DCC-EX Command Station**, to *configure, monitor, and interact with your layout* visually on your PC!

Download the latest Windows EX-RIDE program installer here.
Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Kebbin-n-Ko/software/releases) page, and read thru the info, before finding the installer below the notes, under **Assets**.

* *This software is in early stages of development, and while it has some functionality, active testing & feedback is encouraged, but it should not be used for connecting to 
full layouts until it is deemed stable enough to be released as a Production version. Instead, it is suggested users connect it to a DCC-EX Command Station that is only controlling a test track with some stand-alone accessories in a workbench-style scenario.*
